				LAHORE: Doctors treating Indian death row convict Sarbajit Singh, comatose in a hospital here in Pakistan after a brutal assault, on Tuesday said his condition has deteriorated though he had not been declared brain dead.
				<br>
				<br>
				Allama Iqbal Medical College principal Mahmood Shaukat, the head of a four-member medical board that is supervising Sarabjit's treatment, confirmed that his condition had deteriorated.
				<br>
				<br>
				"He continues to be serious but has not been declared brain dead," Shaukat told PTI.
				<br>
				<br>
				"In our latest investigation, there was no sign of improvement (in Sarabjit's condition). Rather, his condition further deteriorated," he said.
				<br>
				<br>
				Sarabjit is in a special intensive care unit of the state-run Jinnah Hospital.
				<br>
				<br>
				Shaukat said top neurosurgeons and physicians are providing Sarabjit the best treatment to save his life.
				<br>
				<br>
				The doctors had changed some medications after the deterioration in his condition.
				<br>
				<br>
				A second CT scan on Sarabjit too did not reveal any signs of improvement, Shaukat said.
				<br>
				<br>
				"The Glasgow Coma Scale of the patient is being monitored on a daily basis," he added.
				<br>
				<br>
				A source had earlier told PTI that Sarabjit's condition was measured as 5 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), which indicates the level of damage to a person's central nervous system.
				<br>
				<br>
				The lowest possible GCS score is 3 while the highest is 15. The GCS assesses level of consciousness after a profound head injury and Sarabjit's reading indicated deep unconsciousness, making his treatment a major neurosurgical challenge for the medical board.
